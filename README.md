Navigate to the project with cd .../Laravel-project_backend-web with ... being the directory this project is installed at

to install frontedn assets:
npm install
nmp run dev

in another terminal to run the development server:
php artisan serve

If the admin account does not work imediatly, run php artisan db:seed this wil seed the database and the standart admin account will be in the Users table.

when setting up the .env file, make sure FILESYSTEM_DISK is set to public instead of local

Make sure both are running, otherwise the project won't be visible.
